# Second_Assignment

Dataloop JSON format to COCO JSON format covertor.
The solution is based on the dataloop website instructions of sdk-converters and sdk-projects: 
https://docs.dataloop.ai/docs/sdk-projects
https://docs.dataloop.ai/docs/sdk-converters
According to the instruction, in order to use the sdk-converter, first you need to login to the dataloop website. 
Next step is to create a project with a given name.
Finally you can use the dl.Converter() funtion to convert the dataloop .json format annotation file to COCO .json format annotation file.

Unfortunatly i got the error during the project creation, so i couldn't verify the functionality of the solution:
